### NOTES
- Enter wrong user information (need to come up with a while loop that allows the user to get prompted again with either create or login, options 1/2 again)
- Which game do you want to play prompt -- remove this + the room architecture? The rooms really arent doing anything since the game is already "plugged in" and ready to go, like a ROM.
- Hangman -- still need to finalize up turn-base (game logic nearing completion)
- Login password encryption within the terminal ex. *****
